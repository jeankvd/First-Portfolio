## Description
The portfolio website that I created from scratch, It serves as my online CV. I wanted a website that would look minimalistic but professional. I used a triage color palette because it simplified  many design options. 
## Technologies
This website was created using HTML, CSS, BootStrap. and JavaScript to reorder columns.  Jquery Plugins such as Typed.js and scrollto.js.
## Issues
While creating this website no significant issues appeared.
## Next Steps
After creating this website I want to create a blog  with the same style. I will also be creating a new page where all my projects display in card like fashion.
